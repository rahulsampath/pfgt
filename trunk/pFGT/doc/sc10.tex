\section{Conclusions}
\label{sc:conclusions}
We have presented fast adaptive parallel algorithms to compute discrete spatial transforms with Gaussian-type kernels.
We introduced a novel translation scheme that leads to significant speed-ups for non-uniform distributions. We described a
 new paradigm that uses octrees to compute these transforms on non-uniform distributions with optimal complexity. 
 We demonstrated the good scalability of our implementation for both uniform as well as non-uniform distributions. The
 code developed as part of this paper will be made publicly available under the terms of the GNU general public license (GPL). 

There are a few more accelerations that we can include in our implementation. Most important of these is the Hermite to 
plane-wave conversion scheme of \cite{fggt} which is known to yield significant speed-ups. Another important direction
 is overlapping communication with computation, which can be done for almost all of the communication steps. For example, 
 the plane-wave expansions can be formed at the inter-processor boundaries first and while they are being communicated 
 across processors, plane-wave expansions can be formed at the interior boxes. 

[HARI: GPU?]

Apart from the parallel algorithms described in this paper, fast solvers for linear parabolic PDEs 
require convolutions with certain non-standard kernels \cite{li09, skv09}. We are currently investigating fast 
parallel algorithms for those kernels. Together, we believe, they will provide promising alternatives 
for applications in high-performance computing.
