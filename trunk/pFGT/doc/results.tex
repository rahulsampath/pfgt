
The scalability experiments were performed on the {\it{Jaguar}} supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). The
 architectural details for this supercomputer can be found in \cite{jaguar}.

\caption{\label{f:isoUniform} Isogranular scalability for an uniform point distribution. For
 this experiment, we set $\epsilon = 10^{-6}$. The reported times for 
each component are the maximum values for that component across all the processors. The total wall-clock
time is reported in bold face.}
