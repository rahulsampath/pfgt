
In this section, we present scalability results using a few test cases.  All the scalability experiments were performed 
on the {\it{Jaguar}} supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). The architectural details for this supercomputer
 can be found in \cite{jaguar}. The code is written in C++ language and built on top of \texttt{PETSc} and \texttt{DENDRO} packages. 
 Specifically, we use \texttt{DENDRO} for managing linear octrees and \texttt{PETSc} for managing distributed regular grids and profiling. 

{\em Example 1.} In this example, we consider a uniform tensor-product grid obtained by using Gaussian quadrature rule to compute (\ref{heat}) within the unit cube. The source strength $f(y)$ is chosen randomly and the targets are same as the sources. We incorporate the acceleration techniques introduced in \cite{fggt} for tensor-product grids. They are based on {\em seperation of variables} and the complexity of the S2W and L2T steps is reduced from $\bigO(p^3 N)$ to $\bigO(p N)$. 

We report the weak scalability results in Figure \ref{fig:uniform}. The problem size is fixed to approximately 30 billion sources/targets per CPU. We get excellent scalabilty in this case--only a 17\% increase in timing as we go from 1 to 4096 CPUs. 
This is expected, however, because the cost is dominated by the S2W and L2T steps and both of them are emnbarassingly parallel in our implementation. There is only one communication step that is required in the W2L step: an \texttt{MPI_Send} operation which communicates the plane-wave expansion of the boundary boxes in a CPU to its immediate neighbors.

 this experiment, we set $\epsilon = 10^{-6}$. The reported times for 
each component are the maximum values for that component across all the processors. The total wall-clock
time is reported in bold face.} \label{fig:uniform}

{\em Example 2.} In this example, we consider a Gaussian random distribution of points in the unit cube. 
We present the weak scalability results in Figure \ref{fig:nonuniform}.
