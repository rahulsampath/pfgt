{\bf MOTIVATION}

In the uniform distribution case, we can precisely estimate the threshold $n_{th}$ that decides whether one should use the truncation algorithm or the expansion based algorithm. However, when the source and target distributions are highly nonuniform, as is the case in most practical applications, it is not straightforward. For example, when we superimpose a regular grid structure of FGT on a nonuniform distribution, some boxes will have lot of points while some are almost empty.

{\bf OCTREES}
We assume sources and targets are the same for simplicity. We also assume that the octree is constructed so that there are no more than a fixed number of points in each leaf node.
