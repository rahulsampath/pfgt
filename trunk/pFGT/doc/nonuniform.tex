
 In the case of uniform point distributions, we could obtain precise estimates for the threshold $n^*$ and use it to 
 choose between the truncation and expansion algorithms to achieve optimal complexity. However, when the source and 
 target distributions are highly non-uniform, as is the case in most practical applications, it is not as
 straightforward. Note that the expansion algorithm is advantageous when there are many sources within a FGT box and
 the truncation algorithm is more suitable otherwise. Hence, to achieve optimal complexity in the non-uniform case, we 
 need a hybrid algorithm that uses the expansion algorithm in regions with a high density of points and the 
 truncation algorithm in other regions. We use an {\em octree} \cite{clr90} data structure to efficiently
 separate out regions with a dense point distribution from regions with a sparse point distribution and use
 it to appropriately choose between the truncation and expansion algorithm in each region. A similar idea was
 used in \cite{veerapaneni08}.  
 
{\em Primer on octrees.} An octree is a tree data structure that is used for spatial decomposition. Every
node of an octree has a maximum of eight children. An octant with no children is
called a ``{\em leaf}'' and an octant with one or more children is
called an ``{\em interior octant}''. The only octant with no parent is the
 ``{\em root}'' and all other octants have exactly one parent. The depth of an octant 
 from the root is referred to as its ``{\em level}''. We use a ``{\em linear}'' octree
representation (i.e., we exclude interior octants) using the ``{\em
Morton encoding}'' scheme \cite{morton66}. Any octant in the domain can be uniquely
identified by specifying one of its vertices, also known as its ``{\em
anchor}'', and its level in the tree. By convention, the anchor of an
octant is its front lower left corner. 

\subsection{Octree based FGT algorithm}
\label{sc:octreefgt}

 Given a point distribution, we construct a linear octree such that there are no more than $m$ points contained within each leaf; we
 use the algorithm described in \cite{octPaper08} to do this. Note that regions with sparse point distributions will contain 
 leaves that are large in size and regions with dense point distributions will contain leaves that are small in size. Just as in 
 the uniform case, we partition the domain into FGT boxes of size $h = \sqrt{\delta}$. We denote the size of leaf $\ell$ by $|\ell|$.
 We use a heuristic parameter, $c$, to mark leaves as either ``Expand'' or ``Direct'' as follows (Figure \ref{f:directExpand}):

{\tt
\begin{algorithmic}
\STATE
  \FOR {each leaf $\ell$}
      \IF {$|\ell| > c h$}
          \STATE Mark $\ell$ as ``Direct''. 
      \ELSE
          \STATE Mark $\ell$ as ``Expand''. 
      \ENDIF
  \ENDFOR
\STATE
\end{algorithmic}
}

We denote the set of direct leaves by $T_d$ and use $T_e$ to represent the set of expand leaves. In order to achieve optimal complexity, the 
orginial FGT \cite{fgt} chooses different schemes for transmitting the source information to the targets 
depending on the sources and target distributions. It, however, did not consider the case where $\delta$ is small, wherein, it will generate a
large number of boxes and thereby higher computational cost. An advantange of our octree based algorithm is that all these cases including 
the small $\delta$ case can be efficiently handled with just the one spatial decomposition into direct and expand leaves. We first summarize 
how the information is transmitted from a source $y$ to a target $x$ and then describe in detail all the steps involved in this algorithm.

\begin{description}
\item[\textbf{S2W}] In this step, we form the plane-wave expansions (\ref{eqn:s2w}) at all the boxes by visiting 
every leaf node in $T_e$. A particular leaf node $\ell$ can either be contained within a box $B$ or can enclose multiple number of boxes\footnote{Since the box size is chosen as $\sqrt{\delta}$, in the general case, there could be cases where boxes and leaf nodes overlap partially. Here, we make a simplifying assumption that $\delta = 2^{-n}$ for some positive 
integer $n$. This assumption can be relaxed easily by setting the box size to be $2^{\lfloor \log_2 \sqrt{\delta} \rfloor}$ correspondinlgy modifying the error estimates for FGT.}. In the former case, we add the contributions from all sources
within $\ell$ to the plane-wave expansion at $B$. In the latter case, we visit each constituent box $B$ and form 
its plane-wave expansion using only those sources that are contained in $B$.

\item[\textbf{W2D}] In this step, the influence of all the sources in $T_e$ is accumulated at all the targets in $T_d$. First, we initialize the transform at all targets in $T_d$ to zero. Then, for each target $x \in T_d$, we find all FGT boxes $B \in T_e$ that are within the support of the kernel centered at $x$. We add the contribution of sources in $B$ to the transform at the $x$ using its plane-wave expansion: 
%
\beq F(x) \, +=\, \sum_{|k| \leq p} \hat{G}(k)  w_k e^{i \lambda k \cdot (x - c^B)} \label{eqn:w2d} \eeq
%
\item[\textbf{D2D}] For each source $y \in T_d$, find all targets $x \in T_d$ such that $x \in \mathcal{I}[y]$ and
 modify the transform at $x$ as:
  
\beq F(x) \,+=\, G_\delta(\norm{x - y}) f(y) \label{eqn:d2d} \eeq

We make use of a few properties of the Morton ordering to search for the targets $x \in T_d \cap \mathcal{I}[y]$ more efficiently. These
are listed below:
\begin{itemize}
\item Let $r = \sqrt{\delta \ln (\frac{1}{\epsilon})}$, $y_{min} = y - (r, r, r)$ and $y_{max} = y + (r, r, r)$. Then, the Morton id of any point in $\mathcal{I}[y]$ will be greater than or equal to the Morton id of $y_{min}$ and less than or equal to that of $y_{max}$.
\item If a point, $z$, is contained within a leaf, $\ell$, then the Morton id of $z$ will be greater than that of $\ell$.
\item If the Morton id of a leaf $l_1$ is less than that of another leaf $l_2$, then the Morton id of any point, $z$, which is
 contained within $l_1$ will also be lesser than that of $l_2$.
\end{itemize}

 We make use of the above properties along with the fact that $T_d$ is sorted in the Morton ordering and
 search for the leaves that contain potential targets rather than searching for the targets directly. After
 shortlisting the set of candidate leaves, we then search for the relevant targets within them.

\item[\textbf{W2L}] Only the boxes that share sources with atleast one expand leaf node are non-empty, that is,
 carry a plane-wave expansion. Based on the distribution of the non-empty boxes, we choose between the modified sweeping
 algorithms for surface or volume distributions discussed in Section \ref{sc:sweep}. 

\item[\textbf{D2L}] This step is the dual of the W2D step. Here, we accumulate the influence of sources in $T_d$ at the targets in $T_e$. For each source $y \in T_d$, we find every box $D$ that is within the support of the kernel centered at $y$ and
modify its local expansion as: 

\beq v_k  \,+=\, \, f(y) e^{i \lambda k \cdot (c^D - y)} \label{eqn:d2l} \eeq

\item[\textbf{L2T}] For each target $x \in T_e$, we evaluate the transform using the local 
expansion of the box $D$ that contains $x$ using equation (\ref{eqn:l2t}).
\end{description}
