In this section, we present scalability results using a few test cases.  

{\em Machine.} The scalability experiments were performed on the {\it{Jaguar}} supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). The architectural details for this supercomputer can be found in \cite{jaguar}.

{\em Implementation.} The code is written in C language and built on top of \texttt{PETSc} and \texttt{DENDRO} packages. Specifically, we use \texttt{DENDRO} for linear octree construction and \texttt{PETSc} for [RAHUL/HARI] and profiling. 

{\em Example 1.} We consider a uniform tensor product grid in the unit cube. We use the techniques introduced in \cite{fggt}. They are based on {\em seperation of variables} and the complexity of the S2W and L2T steps is reduced to $\bigO(p N)$. We present the weak scalability results in Figure \ref{fig:uniform}.

\caption{\label{f:isoUniform} Isogranular scalability for an uniform point distribution. For
 this experiment, we set $\epsilon = 10^{-6}$. The reported times for 
each component are the maximum values for that component across all the processors. The total wall-clock
time is reported in bold face.} \label{fig:uniform}

{\em Example 2.} In this example, we consider a Gaussian random distribution of points in the unit cube. 
We present the weak scalability results in Figure \ref{fig:nonuniform}.

 this experiment, we set $\epsilon = 10^{-3}$. The reported times for each component are the
 maximum values for that component across all the processors. The total wall-clock
time is reported in bold face.} \label{fig:nonuniform}
