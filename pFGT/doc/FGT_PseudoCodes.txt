Octree Overall Algorithm
Input: Sorted (Morton order) distributed linear octree with a tensor product grid of source and target points inside each leaf. Sources = Targets
1. Construct a regular grid of FGT boxes partitioned across processors. Each processor owns a sub-grid of boxes. Each box is owned by an unique processor. Note, the FGT partitioning is different from the octree partitoning. 
2. Mark each leaf as either Expand or Direct depending on its size.
